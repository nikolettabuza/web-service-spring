##RESTful Web Service with Spring MVC

The purpose of this RESTful Web Service project is to practice and gain more practical knowledge on the topic.

Since I have already used JAX-RS with CXF during work, I was originally planning to utilize the advantages of SpringBoot in this project and go with the reference implementation of JAX-RS: Jersey.
However, after an extensive research I came to the conclusion that it is best not to mix things up when we have a choice, even if Spring is flexible like that, so I decided to go with Spring MVC. Also, I have already used JAX-RS+Jersey before, I needed a new perspective on the RESTful web service subject. 

The [endpoints](#resource-url-patterns) have two versions (except for the landing page): 
*  one that returns a JSON response (this version is the best when using cURL);
*  one that is intended to be called from a browser since it returns the response in (a very simple-looking) HTML format generated by Thymeleaf, a template engine.

We can call any of the endpoints from either of the mentioned clients but the HTML is less readable in the terminal and JSON might be less readable for some people in a browser compared to HTML.
In case I continue with this project, I will remove the template engine solution entirely and continue with JSON responses.

For testing, 2 hard-coded entities are available.

####How to run the app
Download the `carsales-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and execute:

     java -jar {path}/{to}/{jar}/carsales-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

###Endpoints

* GET
* returns a resource with the available endpoints 


    localhost:8081

####Resource URL patterns:

####1. Greeting
   * GET
   * returns a greeting message
   * Path parameter
     * {**name**}
       * *optional*
       * *string*

cURL:

    /greeting/{name}

![example](src/main/resources/static/greeting-example.png?raw=true)



Browser:

    /t/greeting/{name}
![example](src/main/resources/static/greeting-t-example.png?raw=true)

####2. Get car by ID
   * GET
   * returns the car with the provided ID (see [Valid IDs](#valid-ids))  
   * Path parameter
     * {**id**}
       * *required*

cURL:

    /car/{id}

Browser:

    /t/car/{id}


####3. Get all cars
   * GET
   * list all cars
    
cURL:

     /cars

Browser:

     /t/cars

###Valid IDs:

     0
